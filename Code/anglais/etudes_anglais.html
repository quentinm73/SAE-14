                <h2>Why These Studies ?</h2>
                <span class="text_studies">I chose the Networks and Telecommunications program for several reasons. First, during Covid, I discovered the world of computers by starting to learn programming languages like Python and C++. I worked on some small projects in HTML and CSS. I immediately enjoyed starting from a blank page to meet a need through computer programs. Then, I continued to acquire various notions until approaching security. I took my first steps with the root.me site, which allowed me to gain knowledge in cybersecurity. Since then, I have continued learning about computers in general, especially through networks, front-end, and back-end. When choosing my wishes on Parcoursup, I was looking for these different notions, and I found the Networks and Telecommunications program that brought together all the notions I wanted to explore in the field of computers.<br><br></span>
                <span class="text_studies">Each part seems important for me to explore: the network is an essential element to understand how machines communicate with each other, security is crucial to protect communications and other elements, and programming is also fundamental. In my opinion, this program allows us to approach many computer notions, which will help us better understand the digital world around us in the future.</span>
