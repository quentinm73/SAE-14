                <h2>Why These Studies</h2>
                <span class="text_project">I would like to pursue the cybersecurity program for several reasons. Security is a major concern today, as all systems must be protected to ensure users' privacy and the proper functioning of industrial machines, among other things. Working in this field would be personally fulfilling, as I've already had the chance to experiment with security, especially on the site root.me, where I carried out my initial SQL injections and participated in CTFs, which were quite entertaining.<br><br></span>
                <span class="text_project">The DevOps cycle can also be intriguing. I appreciate the notion of starting from scratch to solve a problem. Engaging in the reflective phase with algorithms, seeking optimizations for the program to operate with minimal resources, and finally developing the program have all previously captivated me. I've been able to create a few computer programs using API gateways or to develop a voice assistant, and each experience has been immensely enjoyable.
                    <br><br></span>
                <span class="text_project">Therefore, I would choose both options, with cybersecurity as my primary choice. However, in either case, I would be content with the proposed path, as both are areas that interest me.<br><br></span>
